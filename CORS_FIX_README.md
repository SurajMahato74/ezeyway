# CORS Issue Fix

## Problem
Your React app running on `localhost:8080` cannot access the production API at `https://ezeyway.com` due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

## Solution Applied
1. **Modified API configuration** to use localhost backend during development
2. **Added endpoint normalization** to handle inconsistent `/api/` prefixes
3. **Added development warnings** to alert when backend is not running

## Files Changed
- `src/config/api.ts` - Updated to use localhost:8000 during development
- `src/utils/apiUtils.ts` - Added endpoint normalization and dev warnings
- `src/utils/devUtils.ts` - New file with development utilities

## What You Need To Do

### Option 1: Start Your Django Backend (Recommended)
1. Navigate to your Django backend project directory
2. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver localhost:8000
   ```
3. Your React app will now connect to the local backend

### Option 2: Use Production API (Not Recommended for Development)
If you want to use the production API, you need to:
1. Configure CORS on your production server to allow `localhost:8080`
2. Or use a proxy server
3. Or temporarily disable CORS in your browser (not secure)

## API Endpoint Patterns Fixed
The code now handles these inconsistent patterns:
- ✅ `/vendor-profiles/` (no /api/ prefix)
- ✅ `/api/orders/vendor/pending/` (with /api/ prefix)
- ✅ `/api/sliders/?user_type=vendor` (with /api/ prefix)

## Development Features Added
- **Backend health check**: Warns if localhost:8000 is not running
- **Automatic endpoint normalization**: Handles /api/ prefix inconsistencies
- **Environment detection**: Automatically switches between dev/prod URLs

## Next Steps
1. Start your Django backend server on `localhost:8000`
2. Refresh your React app
3. The CORS errors should be resolved
4. Check the browser console for any remaining issues

## Troubleshooting
- If you see a yellow warning banner, your backend server is not running
- Check that your Django server is running on port 8000
- Ensure your Django settings allow CORS from localhost:8080
