# Authentication Persistence Fix for Capacitor Mobile App

## Problem
Users were being asked to login again every time they closed and reopened the mobile app, even though they had already logged in successfully.

## Root Cause
The app was using `localStorage` for authentication persistence, which can be cleared by the mobile OS when the app is closed or when the system needs memory. This is a common issue in Capacitor/Cordova apps.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created AuthService (`src/services/authService.ts`)
- Uses Capacitor's `Preferences` plugin for mobile devices (persistent storage)
- Falls back to `localStorage` for web browsers
- Handles authentication tokens, user data, cart, and wishlist persistence
- Includes session validation with 30-minute timeout
- Provides unified API for all authentication operations

### 2. Updated AppContext (`src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`)
- Modified to use the new `authService` instead of direct `localStorage`
- Updated login/logout functions to be async and use persistent storage
- Enhanced data loading to check session validity on app startup

### 3. Updated Login Components
- **Login.tsx**: Updated to use `authService` for storing authentication data
- **VendorLogin.tsx**: Updated to use `authService` for vendor authentication

### 4. Enhanced Session Management (`src/hooks/useSessionManager.ts`)
- Updated to use `authService` for all storage operations
- Improved session validation and cleanup

### 5. Created AuthGuard Component (`src/components/AuthGuard.tsx`)
- Handles authentication initialization on app startup
- Shows loading screen while checking authentication status
- Automatically restores user session if valid

### 6. Added App Lifecycle Management
- **CapacitorUtils** (`src/utils/capacitorUtils.ts`): Utility for handling app lifecycle events
- **App.tsx**: Enhanced with app state listeners to handle authentication when app becomes active/inactive

### 7. Updated Profile Page (`src/pages/Profile.tsx`)
- Updated logout functionality to use `authService`
- Enhanced profile data fetching to use persistent storage

## Key Features

### Persistent Authentication
- Authentication data survives app restarts
- Works on both mobile and web platforms
- Automatic session restoration on app launch

### Session Management
- 30-minute session timeout for security
- Automatic session extension on user activity
- Session validation when app becomes active

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Uses Capacitor Preferences on mobile for true persistence
- Falls back to localStorage on web browsers
- Unified API regardless of platform

### Security Features
- Automatic session cleanup on expiration
- Secure token storage using native device capabilities
- Activity-based session extension

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `src/services/authService.ts` - Main authentication service
- `src/components/AuthGuard.tsx` - Authentication initialization component
- `src/utils/capacitorUtils.ts` - Capacitor utility functions
- `AUTHENTICATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx` - Updated to use authService
- `src/pages/Login.tsx` - Updated authentication flow
- `src/pages/vendor/VendorLogin.tsx` - Updated vendor authentication
- `src/hooks/useSessionManager.ts` - Enhanced session management
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx` - Updated logout and profile operations
- `src/App.tsx` - Added AuthGuard and lifecycle management

## How It Works

1. **App Launch**: AuthGuard checks for existing authentication and restores session if valid
2. **Login**: Authentication data is stored using Capacitor Preferences (mobile) or localStorage (web)
3. **App Usage**: Session is automatically extended on user activity
4. **App Backgrounding**: Last activity timestamp is updated
5. **App Resuming**: Session validity is checked, expired sessions are cleared
6. **Logout**: All authentication data is securely cleared from persistent storage

## Benefits

✅ **No More Re-login Required**: Users stay logged in between app sessions
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on both mobile and web
✅ **Secure**: Includes session timeouts and validation
✅ **Automatic**: No user intervention required
✅ **Reliable**: Uses native device storage capabilities

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Login to the app
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app
4. User should remain logged in and be taken to the home screen

The authentication will persist until:
- User manually logs out
- Session expires (30 minutes of inactivity)
- App data is cleared by the user
